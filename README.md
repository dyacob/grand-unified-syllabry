# The Grand Unified Syllabary
The Grand Unified Syllabary project (GUS) aims to map all syllabaries supported in Unicode onto a single linguistic frame of reference; a syllabic hypercube. A "Syllables.txt" file will be produced, intended as a companion to the Unicode data files.


## Status
This is a transfer of original [SourceForge project](https://sourceforge.net/projects/syllabary/) created on April 4, 2001.

A small companion [website](https://syllabary.sourceforge.net/) was also created for the original project.
