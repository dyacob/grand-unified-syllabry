  <li> Note:
    <ul>
      <li> No IPA analysis nor mappings have been made at this time.
      <li> The high tone form has defaulted for the class base, should the toneless form be the base?
      <li> Does the writing system use the notion of syllabic forms (what are their names)?
      <li> Is the "middle low" tone essentially toneless?  That is, roughly equivalent to intonation in languages that do not define tones?
      <li> Do "ur" and "yr" syllabic forms closed syllables?
    </ul>
