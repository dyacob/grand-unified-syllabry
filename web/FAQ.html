<h1><u>GUS Frequently Asked Questions</u></h1>

<ol>
<a name="coverage"></a><h2><li><u>What syllabaries are covered by GUS?</u></h2>

<p align="justify">As GUS is at heart a mapping of code points, code points from a common character set are prerequisite.  Presently only those syllabaries that are a part of the Unicode 3.1 standard and the ISO-10646 Basic Multilingual Plane.  We may venture out of the BMP as additional syllabaries are encoded and as volunteers become available.</p>

<a name="family"></a><h2><li><u>Why are syllabaries, like Hangul or Malayalam, not covered?</u></h2>
<p align="justify">These syllabaries ("alphasyllabaries") rely on diacritic marks, as a separate
character code, to compose a syllable from a base consonant.  The base letter and the diacritic
being two separate character codes, the same text processing issue does not arise as it does for
syllabaries not employing diacritics (where a single character code represents each syllable).</p>

<p align="justify">Stated another way, the GUS project addresses all Unicode code points that
represent at least a "CV" symbol (to a maximum extent of a "CVCT" symbol) where the "V"
component can not be modified by other symbols as a means to form the base of a new syllable.</p>

<a name="family"></a><h2><li><u>What is a syllabic "family"?</u></h2>
<p align="justify">A syllabic family is a set of symbols derived from a common
phoneme or glyph.  Usually this means all syllables with a common initial
consonant.  The term "series" is interchangeable with "family".</p>


<a name="family"></a><h2><li><u>What is a syllabic "form"?</u></h2>
<p align="justify">Some syllabaries (Ethiopic for example) make use of the
notion that each syllable represents a single "form" (or family member) in a
syllabic series.  In Roman script the best analogy would be the distinction 
between "B" and "b" as two forms of the same letter.  A syllabary may be
thought of as a script where each letter has a new case that corresponds
to each vowel in the language using it.  So in an English syllabary we would
have "cases" for at least "Ba", "Be", "Bi", "Bo", "Bu".  Of course the "cases"
now become more important to writing than they did before as the each carry an
implicit vowel.</p>

<p align="justify">These cases, which we here after to as a "form" or "order", may have proper names.  Rather than derive a unified naming convention for the syllabic orders, we have opted to enumerate them beginning from 1.</p>


<a name="uber"></a><h2><li><u>What about locales?</u></h2>
<p align="justify">In some cases more than one language will make use of a
given syllabary and may do so in a unique way.  When different consonant or
vowel associations occur for a given symbol the consequence to GUS would mean
a competing mapping of the symbol.  Which then do we decide is the "correct"?</p>

<p align="justify">It is intended that the GUS table be applied in localised
software and so the GUS table will have to be localised.  Perhaps broken into
components based on script and language, specifics are as of yet to be worked
out by project participants.  The normative form of GUS will make use of
traditional rules to the extent possible, hopefully avoiding bias towards
present day languages.</p>

<p align="justify">While vowel assignments may change between languages, it is
not expected that form ordering will change accordingly.  The present treatment
of forms assumes that they are locale independent and thus fixed.  Note that
this also means that forms and vowels become independent from one another.</p>


<a name="family"></a><h2><li><u>How are consonant clusters treated?</u></h2>
<p align="justify">Some syllables may represent CCVCC type patterns.  The
project team will need to be careful to not be confused by English
transcription when mapping these syllables.  When an IPA symbol is not
available for a CC pattern, two IPA consonant symbols will be used as a single
position on the "C" axis.</p>
