<h3><u>General Status Effecting all Scripts</u></h3>
<dl>
<dt><strong>Encompassed Scripts</strong></dt>
  <dd><p align="justify">It is believed that all scripts that should be
encompassed by this project have been correctly identified.</p></dd>

<dt><strong>Consonant Mappings</strong></dt>
  <dd><p align="justify">Presently mappings are made as per the leading
  consonant in the Unicode character names.  Effort has not begun to map
  the characters onto IPA symbols.</p></dd>

<dt><strong>Vowel Mappings</strong></dt>
  <dd><p align="justify">Seven short vowels and corresponding long vowels
  have been devised in ASCII to associate with syllables.  These vowels
  have been applied to all scripts with the exception of Yi where the vowels
  are not well understood at this stage.  This correlation represents a
  "first pass" effort and do need to be verified and double checked.
  Effort has not begun to map the characters onto IPA symbols.</p></dd>

<dt><strong>Labialization Mappings</strong></dt>
  <dd><p align="justify">Labialized syllables are treated presently as a unique
  syllable type.  This is an extension of the general tying of forms to
  syllables (the labial syllables do indeed represent unique forms).  This
  point should be discussed by participants.</p></dd>

<dt><strong>Use of Forms</strong></dt>
  <dd><p align="justify">Which scripts use the notion of "forms" needs to
  be investigated thoroughly.  Should forms be assigned based on family and
  sort order for those scripts not applying the form notion?</p></dd>
